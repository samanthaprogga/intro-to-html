Intro to Web Development

Guidelines and best practices

** Read this before starting/submitting an assignment**

- Your code must be clear, well-formatted, readable and easy to understand
- Ask for clarification. There is no 'I guess' in our assignments.
- Look for examples online (always),and ask yourself if that particular
  element/feature makes sense.
- Name your main html file'index.html'
- File and folder names always in lowercase characters (with dashes instead
of empty spaces)
- Consistency and CARP principles are required
- Indentation is important. We can use either 2 or 4 spaces
- Avoid side-scrolling in your code
- Use only English in your assignment
- In web design, details matter
- Use only one <h1> ,<header>, <footer>, <main>, <article> per page
- Do not use <br>. That's CSS' job
- Don't keep links with their default colour
- Use "target="_blank' when opening external pages
- Css reset and containers are always required-Cinsistency and carp principles are also required
-In web design we don't use random colours. There is a science behind 
the colours we pick
-Borders,shadows,transition,animation should be smooth and subtle
-Dark mode is not about white text over black background.It'ss more complex
than that (again,get examples online)
